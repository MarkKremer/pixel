# Plugins

## Introduction

Plugins are a way to extend the features and functionality of Pixel. They are the communities contribution
to pushing Pixel to the next level.


## Plugin List

* [gameloop](gameloop/README.md) - A plugin that allows you to run a game loop in Pixel.


## Creating a Plugin

Plugins are just a collection of files that are placed in the `plugins` directory. The directory name
is the name of the plugin. The plugin directory must contain a `README.md` file that describes the plugin.
Make sure to provide some example code in the **README** so that users are aware of how to use the plugin.

You are encouraged to create an example of your plugin in the [pixel-examples](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel-examples). This will allow users
to see your plugin in action and how to use it.
